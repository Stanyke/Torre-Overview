# Torre-Overview
This is an overview of the available APIs from Torre.co

This web application consumes a couple of APIs provided by Torre to its users/developers to make job lookouts easier as there're numerous people and jobs available in their platform/API.

## Links (url)
- Profile/Homepage url: https://torre-overview.herokuapp.com
- Jobs page url: https://torre-overview.herokuapp.com/jobs

## How it works

1. The homepage is loadedautomatically, displaying my profile deatils by default using my username on Torre (my profile username is **Stanyke**).

- In the homepage, user can input any username (that's from Torre) in the search box to access the brief detail about the person.

- Also users can filter out a couple of people using the Page Number they want to start counting from, People size (how many people that should be fetched) and the aggregate.
    - Note that is inputs are numbers and cannot be less than zero.
    - After inputting the number, the user can hit the enter key or click on the **Filter People**'s button.


2. There's a button named **Find Jobs** which is used in navigating to the page where the user can look up for jobs from Torre.

- In this page a particular job is loaded by default, also users can use the search box to lookup for a particular ones they have the **Job's ID** (this is kind of similar to useername search in the homepage).

- There's also a filter for job opportunities where the users input their preferred starting page and how many jobs to be displayed (this is similar to the people filter in the homepage).

- The user can now see a particualar **Job ID** from the listed jobs provided with the help of filter (this is going to help the user in actually viewing a particular job using the search bar, to get more detail about that job).
